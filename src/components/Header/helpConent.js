      Value stream mapping is the first step in improving a process flow. Using
      the informaton in the VSM, we can identify the constraints we need to
      tackle first to maximize improvement of flow through the value stream.
      Classically, this is done by observing every step in a process and
      capturing the actual time taken for each step. This is not as easy with
      software delivery.
