      Large improvements are the result of disciplened small improvements over
      time. Hopefully some of these tools will help, but the main thing to
      understand is that improving outcomes is both simple and complex at the
      same time. The steps to take are simple: determine where we are, plan the
      next action to reduce waste and delays, establish how we will measure
      success, perform the next improvement action, verify the results, and use
      the outcomes to inform he next action. This is complex because people are
      involved and anything to do with people collaborating is not a simple
      activity.
